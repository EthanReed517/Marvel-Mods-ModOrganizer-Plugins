These plugins go into `plugins` directly. The usual location is `C:\Modding\MO2\plugins`.

#### Contents:
- Patch Herostat Mod: Modify the herostat mod, so it works correctly.
- Patch RH: Add the roster hack to the correct location in the game files. Warning: Anti-virus programs can remove the roster hack without notification, in which case the RH doesn't work, even if patched.
- Patch All: Does both of the above with a single click.

#### Notes:
- These plugins should be combined with the game plugins for easier installation (game_MUA1.py and game_XML2.py only).
