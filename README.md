These plugins can be added to Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) to get it to accept **X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse**, the 2006 PC version of **Marvel: Ultimate Alliance**, the 2016 Steam version of **Marvel: Ultimate Alliance**, and the 2016 Steam version of **Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2**

## Compatibility

## Usage

 1. [Download the archive](https://github.com/EthanReed517/Marvel-Mods-ModOrganizer-Plugins/releases/latest) for the game version you want to add to MO2.
 2. Extract the `basic_games` folder to the MO2 `plugins` folder or add the .py file in the `basic_games\games` folder of the downloaded archive to your MO2 install at `plugins\basic_games\games`. The usual location is `C:\Modding\MO2\plugins\basic_games\games`. After (re-)starting ModOrganizer, it will now be able to recognize the respective version of the [game](#compatibility).
