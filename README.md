# Marvel Mods ModOrganizer Plugins
These plugins can be added to Mod Organizer to get it to accept **X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse**, the 2006 PC version of **Marvel: Ultimate Alliance**, the 2016 Steam version of **Marvel: Ultimate Alliance**, and the 2016 Steam version of **Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2**

## Compatibility
XML2 PC, MUA1 PC, MUA1 Steam PC, MUA2 Steam PC

## Usage

 1. Add the files to your MO2 install at `plugins\basic_games\games`. The usual location is `C:\Modding\MO2\plugins\basic_games\games`. After (re-)starting ModOrganizer, it will now be able to recognize the PC versions of XML2 and MUA1, as well as the Steam versions of MUA1 and MUA2.
